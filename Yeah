                            The libraries we will be using are all in Python, and include:

                    Yeah this is just to see what happens if we create another ~<~p> type thingo

                <p>
                    Just something to note, in the lecture slides, Dr.Hassan often uses the ">>>" symbol. This is simply to show how the command line would be entered in the Python IDE.

                   <ul>
                    <li>
                        Libraries are just things <!--Find the proper word--> which contain useful functions and definitions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each library is divided into modules.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For example, a <p id = "italics">module</p> in the Python standard library is the math module, which contains functions and definitions for maths.
                        
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To use a library, we have to import it using the "import" system call(not sure if this actually what its called in Python)
                    </li>
                   </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    List Operations
                    <ul>
                        <li>Concatenation
                            <ul>
                                <li>Lists can be concatenated simply by using the "+" operator.</li> 
                                <li>Lists in Python can also be concatenated by using the ".append()" function. The notation for this is:
                                
                                    list_name.append(x)
                                    
                                    Where x represents the elements you want to append, for example a number, string or even another list.
                                    Note however, that if we append another list, this will mean that the list will be added to the list as a single element: The elements inside the added list will not be counted as separate elements in the outer list.
                                
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Sorting
                            <ul>
                                Sorting is achieved through the ".sort()" function.
                                
                            </ul>
                        </li>
